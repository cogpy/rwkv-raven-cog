## üß† Key Concepts

### RWKV Architecture
RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) is a novel neural network architecture that combines the benefits of RNNs and Transformers, offering efficient training and inference while maintaining strong performance.

### OpenCog Framework
OpenCog is a cognitive architecture framework designed for artificial general intelligence (AGI) research, featuring symbolic-subsymbolic integration through its Atomspace knowledge representation system.

### Cognitive Transformation
Our transformation process maps RWKV's neural components to OpenCog's cognitive modules, creating a hybrid system that leverages both subsymbolic neural processing and symbolic reasoning capabilities.

## üìê Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each cognitive function is encapsulated in separate, well-defined modules
2. **Symbolic-Subsymbolic Bridge**: Seamless integration between neural and symbolic components
3. **Attention-Driven**: Dynamic attention allocation across cognitive processes
4. **Pattern-Based Reasoning**: Template-driven symbolic pattern matching
5. **Scalable Design**: Efficient handling of large-scale model transformations
